看完这个[这个视频](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UuvwY6CdLo)解决了我多年的困扰，原来这个机器人检测是真的有用！

> In the video, it is explained why robots can't check the box that says "I'm not a robot". The box is a newer version of a system that used to be called CAPTCHA. CAPTCHAs were designed to tell computers and humans apart, but as robots got smarter, they became too easy for robots to solve. So, Google invented reCAPTCHA, which is a new system that is harder for robots to beat. reCAPTCHA tracks the way your mouse moves and your browsing history to determine if you are a human or a robot. If the site is still unsure, you will have to click on squares with images of things like fire hydrants or crosswalks. Modern recaptures also examine your browsing history, which is the clearest giveaway of who is human and what is a bot.

### 总结

- 机器人快准狠，而我是废物，点的慢，选不准，所以我不是机器人
